## Project Objective
The project aim to Develop a machine-learning model for predicting the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on there health features.

## Data Sources
The Dataset used in these project was provided by 10Alytics. The dataset contains relevant health data from patients at Peterside Hospital, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors and results from diagnostic test.

## Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, extensive data preprocessing was performed. This include handling missing values, outliers and inconsistencies. This steps involves feature engineering, normalization and encoding categorical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
Ranging from Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate data analysis was performed to gain insights into the relationships between features and there impact on heart disease risk. This steps helps identify patterns, correlations and potential predictive variables.

## Machine Learning Model
The heart disease model was built using a supervised machine learning approach. Training and test data was split 80:20. Several  classsification algorithm were experimented with

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbours**
- **Decision Trees**

After extensive experimentaion and hyperparameter tuning, the final machine learning model was selected based on the performance and generalization capabilities.
